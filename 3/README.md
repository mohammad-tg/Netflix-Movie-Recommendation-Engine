Netflix Movie Recommendation Engine
This project is a content-based recommendation system for Netflix movies and TV shows using Python and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

How it Works
The engine analyzes movie descriptions to find similarities between titles.

Vectorization: Uses TfidfVectorizer to convert text data into numerical vectors.

Similarity: Calculates the cosine similarity between movies.

Results: When given a movie title, it returns the top 10 most similar titles.

Example Result
For the movie "Ganglands", the system recommends titles like "Narcos", "Den of Thieves", and "Security".
